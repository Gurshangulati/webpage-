    <h2>My thoughts</h2>
    <p>I think HTML is like learning a new language because you have to write all these weird letters any symbols that you don't understand but with more time you can read it no problem.</p>
  <p>I thing it is very annoying that I have to write the same thing twice but I understand why I have to do that now.</p>
  <p>I think it is very easy to understand when you know the basics but some stuff is to complicated.<p>

        <td>I get to sit down and research. Some people find it very boring but I find it to be the perfect thing to do it the morning.</td>
        <td>When you are done your work there isn't really anything to do so you just sit there either sleeping or just playing games</td>
